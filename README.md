# Sun_OSCPU
First step out on  Open Source Chip Project by University (OSCPU)

Initial parts of a single cycle RISCV64I CPU include the following files:
defines.v
if_stage.v
regfile.v
id_stage.v
exe_stage.v
mem_stage.v
ram_1w2r.v
wb.v
With SimTop.v as the top file for tests
Up to now we have used difftest offered by NJU-ProjectN to test on the whole project, and successfully we have passed cpu-tests and riscv-tests.
Although the first step out takes more time than we expect, its still a huge progress of our 5 weeks' work.

The next stage is on the road.
